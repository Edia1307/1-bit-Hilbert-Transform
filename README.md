# This is the program of the 1-bit Hilbert Transform for signed signals with sparse prior.  Owing to the advantages of low cost and easy implementation, the 1-bit sampling technique attracts more and more attention recently. However, how to generate the imaginary component of the 1-bit signal continues to be an open problem in the literature. To this end, we propose an algorithm to construct the analytic signal for the real-valued 1-bit signal based on the 1-bit compressive sensing method. As an example we conduct the  transform on the signal consisting of three simple sine waves. Simulations show that the proposed method can obtain the analytical 1-bit signal with a reasonable accuracy.
